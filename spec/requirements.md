# Ticket 1: Create initial project setup

**Description**  
The "Create initial project setup" feature establishes the foundational structure of the Parcel Delivery Management System. This setup includes a management component and a basic user interface module, providing the groundwork for future development. The initial project setup does not incorporate any business logic, focusing instead on creating a framework that allows for the integration of functionalities related to tracking and managing parcel deliveries. This feature is essential for ensuring that the project has a clear organizational structure and user interface from the outset, facilitating further development and implementation of more complex features.

**Functionality**  
- Create a project repository with a defined structure for the Parcel Delivery Management System.
- Implement a management component that allows for the organization of project files and resources.
- Develop a basic user interface module that includes essential UI elements for user interaction.
- Ensure that the initial setup is free of business logic, focusing solely on structural components.
- Provide a centralized dashboard layout that can be expanded with future functionalities.
- Include placeholder elements for future features such as tracking, filtering, and reporting.
- Allow for easy navigation within the UI module to facilitate user experience during development.

**Requirements**  
- Set up a version control system (e.g., Git) for managing project files and collaboration.
- Create a project directory structure that includes folders for management components, UI modules, and documentation.
- Develop the UI module using a front-end framework (e.g., React, Angular) to ensure scalability and responsiveness.
- Implement a basic layout for the centralized dashboard that can be populated with data in future iterations.
- Ensure that the initial setup adheres to coding standards and best practices for maintainability.
- Document the project setup process and structure for future reference by developers.
- Prepare the environment for integration with backend services that will handle business logic in subsequent phases.
